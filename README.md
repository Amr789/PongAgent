🕹️ Mastering Pong with Deep Reinforcement Learning
This project explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques—DQN, Actor-Critic, and PPO—to master the classic Atari game Pong. The goal is to compare and analyze the learning performance of each algorithm using PyTorch and OpenAI Gym environments.

📌 Project Overview
Environment: Pong-v0 (Atari Pong via OpenAI Gym)

Frameworks: PyTorch, Gymnasium/OpenAI Gym

Algorithms Implemented:

🎯 Deep Q-Network (DQN)

🧠 Actor-Critic

🔁 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Each agent is trained from pixel input using convolutional layers and learns through trial and error to beat the opponent.

🧠 Algorithms & Highlights
🔹 DQN
Experience replay buffer

Target network

Epsilon-greedy policy

🔹 Actor-Critic
Simultaneous policy and value updates

Uses advantage estimation

🔹 PPO
Clipped surrogate objective

Stable and efficient training
